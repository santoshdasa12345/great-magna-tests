    Given "Annette Geissinger" is an unauthenticated supplier
    And "Annette Geissinger" created an "unverified Individual" profile

    When "Annette Geissinger" attempts to sign in to SSO/great.gov.uk account

  Scenario: Suppliers should not be able to register with the same email again
    # No error should be displayed when Supplier attempts to register with an
    # existing email address (intended behaviour) yet no verification email
    # should be sent. Moreover there's no point in checking in DB whether
    # there's only 1 account with the same email address as there's `unique`
    # constraint configured on the `email` column.
